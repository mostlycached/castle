# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 035

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The War Room
* **Wing:** III. The Machine Shop (Production)
* **Phase Space:** High ($D$) / High ($A$)
* **Archetype:** The Crisis Engine

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
When the ordinary breaks down, crisis emerges. The War Room is the emergency protocol—all hands, all resources, all attention concentrated on a single burning problem until it is resolved.

$$\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} \to \infty; \quad \text{All } R_i \to R_{\text{crisis}}; \quad \text{Terminate only on resolution}$$

* **Input Logic:** Crisis signal. Broken production. Existential threat. Time pressure.
* **Output Logic:** Resolution. Problem solved, contained, or triaged. Return from emergency footing.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"In times of peace, the warlike man attacks himself."**
> But when true war comes, the warlike man finds his purpose. The War Room is not where you want to live—but it is where you prove what you're made of. Here, exhaustion is irrelevant. Comfort is cancelled. There is only the problem and the will to solve it. The War Room strips away everything until only the essential remains: *Can you perform when it matters most?*

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Crisis Trigger:** The War Room activates only for genuine emergencies. Do not cry wolf.
2.  **The Resource Mobilization:** All available attention, personnel, and tools are redirected.
3.  **The Exit Condition:** Defined resolution criteria. The War Room closes when the crisis ends.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Status Board:** What is broken. What is being tried. What is working.
2.  **The Communication Channel:** Fast, clear, no ceremony.
3.  **The Caffeine / Sustenance:** The body must be maintained even in extremity.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Assess the crisis. Declare: "The War Room is open." All normal operations suspend.
* **Step 1:** Triage. What is the most critical failure? Attack that first.
* **Step 2:** Iterate. Try, observe, adjust. Document as you go. Do not panic.
* **Exit Rite:** When the crisis is resolved or contained, declare: "The War Room closes." Debrief. Document. Then collapse and recover.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** Living in the War Room. Every problem becomes a "crisis." The emergency mode becomes permanent.
* **The Result:** **Chronic Burnout.** The body cannot sustain crisis indefinitely. The War Room drains reserves that must be replenished. Those who never leave the War Room have no reserves when real crisis strikes.
