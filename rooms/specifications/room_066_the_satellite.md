# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 066

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Satellite
* **Wing:** VI. The Observatory (Metacognition)
* **Phase Space:** Meta-State (Distance)
* **Archetype:** The Perspective Shifter

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
Distance changes vision. The Satellite is physical or psychological removal from the daily context—the perspective shift that comes from seeing your life from far away.

$$\text{Perspective} = \lim_{d \to \infty} \text{View}(\text{Life}, d) - \text{View}(\text{Life}, 0)$$

* **Input Logic:** Travel, relocation, or meditative distance.
* **Output Logic:** Clarified priorities. Things that seemed important shrink. Things that seemed small grow.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"We are unknown to ourselves."**
> Precisely because we are too close. The Satellite is the room where you zoom out—physically through travel, or mentally through contemplation—and see the whole for what it is. From the airport. From the mountain. From the stranger's country. The urgent becomes trivial. The essential becomes visible. The Satellite teaches: your life looks different from a distance, and that view is also true.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Distance Requirement:** Physical or psychological—you must be *away* from the normal.
2.  **The Reflection Mandate:** Distance without reflection is tourism. See your life from here.
3.  **The Return:** You come back. The Satellite is not escape—it is perspective for return.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Displacement:** Airplane, foreign city, retreat, wilderness.
2.  **The Journal:** Capture the shifted view.
3.  **The Time:** Long enough for the shift to settle.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Leave the familiar. Say: "I see from a distance."
* **Step 1:** Let the normal recede. Notice what you miss.
* **Step 2:** Notice what you don't miss. What feels essential from here?
* **Exit Rite:** Before returning, capture the insights. Say: "I return with new eyes."

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** The Satellite becomes escape. You leave and never return, avoiding rather than gaining perspective.
* **The Result:** **Permanent Drift.** What was meant to be clarifying becomes avoidance. You escape your life rather than understanding it.
