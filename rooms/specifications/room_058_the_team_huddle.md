# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 058

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Team Huddle
* **Wing:** V. The Forum (Exchange)
* **Phase Space:** Medium ($D$) / High ($A$)
* **Archetype:** The Vector Aligner

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
Teams generate power through alignment. The Huddle is where scattered vectors are synchronized—shared context established, roles clarified, momentum unified.

$$\vec{v}_{\text{team}} = \sum_i \vec{v}_i; \quad \text{Alignment} \Rightarrow |\vec{v}_{\text{team}}| \gg \sum_i |\vec{v}_i| \cdot \cos(\theta_i)$$

* **Input Logic:** Team members with individual contexts, agendas, blockers.
* **Output Logic:** Synchronized state. Shared understanding. Coordinated action.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe."**
> But sometimes the tribe is your team, and the struggle is to *align*, not to escape. The Huddle is the ritual that keeps the team from fragmenting into parallel individuals. Here, we share what we know, what we don't know, what we need. No one person holds the full picture—but after the Huddle, each person holds *enough* of the picture to act coherently.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Time Box:** Huddles are short. 15 minutes. Do not let them sprawl.
2.  **The Update-Only Focus:** This is not the space for deep discussion. Share state, flag blockers, move on.
3.  **The Attendance Requirement:** All relevant members must be present.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Circle (Physical or Virtual):** Everyone faces everyone.
2.  **The Agenda:** Consistent format. Same questions each time.
3.  **The Timer:** Visible. Enforced.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Gather. Start precisely on time. Say: "We align."
* **Step 1:** Each member answers: What did I do? What am I doing? What blocks me?
* **Step 2:** Blockers are noted (solved later). Dependencies are flagged.
* **Exit Rite:** The meeting ends on time. Say: "We are aligned." Disperse.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** Huddles become discussions. 15 minutes becomes an hour.
* **The Result:** **Meeting Bloat.** The Huddle, which was meant to save time, now *consumes* time. People dread it. They zone out. Alignment is lost, not gained.
