# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 022

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Courtroom
* **Wing:** II. The Administration (Governance)
* **Phase Space:** Low ($D$) / High ($A$)
* **Archetype:** The Decision Tribunal

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
Decisions deferred are energy leaked. Every open question consumes background processing. The Courtroom forces resolution—evidence is weighed, arguments heard, and the gavel falls.

$$E_{\text{decision}} = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i; \quad \text{Verdict} \Rightarrow p_i \in \{0, 1\}$$

* **Input Logic:** Unresolved choices. Competing options. Suspended judgment.
* **Output Logic:** Decision made. Uncertainty collapsed. Path committed.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one."**
> But before starting, you must *choose*. And choice is what the modern abundance-paralyzed psyche cannot do. The Courtroom is where you stop gathering evidence and *rule*. Not because you have perfect information—you never will—but because action requires decision and indecision is its own slow death.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Decision Focus:** Enter only with a specific choice to make. No wandering.
2.  **The Time Limit:** The deliberation is bounded. When time ends, a decision is rendered.
3.  **The Finality Rule:** Once the verdict is announced, do not revisit. The case is closed.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Options List:** Clearly enumerated choices. No more, no less.
2.  **The Criteria Framework:** What values are at stake? What outcomes matter?
3.  **The Decision Record:** Write the verdict and the reasoning. Future you may need to know.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** State the question clearly: "The court is now in session regarding X."
* **Step 1:** Present the evidence. What do I know? What are the options? What are the tradeoffs?
* **Step 2:** Apply the criteria. Which option best serves my values?
* **Step 3:** Deliberate briefly. Set the timer. When it ends: decide.
* **Exit Rite:** Announce the verdict aloud: "It is decided. I choose Y." Record it. Leave and act.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** Endless deliberation. "I need more information." The decision is deferred indefinitely.
* **The Result:** **Decision Debt.** The choice remains open, consuming cognitive resources, blocking downstream action. Life calcifies around the unchosen.
