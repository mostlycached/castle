# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 012

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Airlock
* **Wing:** I. The Foundation (Restoration)
* **Phase Space:** Transitional State ($D \to D'$, $A \to A'$)
* **Archetype:** The Phase Transition Chamber

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
The Airlock is not a destination—it is a transformation zone. Like the decompression chamber that prevents deep-sea divers from dying of the bends, this room prevents psychological rupture when moving between radically different phase spaces.

$$\frac{d\Psi}{dt} \bigg|_{\text{transition}} \leq \frac{d\Psi}{dt} \bigg|_{\text{max safe}}$$

* **Input Logic:** State from previous room (work, home, public, private).
* **Output Logic:** Gradual acclimatization to the next room's demands.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"There are no beautiful surfaces without a terrible depth."**
> The modern world pretends that transitions are free. You leave the office and arrive home instantly. You leave sleep and arrive at work without passage. This is violence against the psyche. The Airlock honors the truth: that you are not a light switch but a living organism, and living organisms require gradients, not discontinuities. The commute, the hallway, the walk between buildings—these are not dead time. They are the essential buffer that allows the self to remain continuous.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Screen Ban:** No checking into the new world early. The phone stays down during passage.
2.  **The Presence Requirement:** The body and mind must move together. No mental rehearsals of the destination.
3.  **The Minimum Duration:** At least 5 minutes of genuine transition. Rushing the Airlock causes the bends.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Physical Path:** Hallway, commute, walk. Some traversable distance.
2.  **The Headphones (Optional):** Music or silence that belongs to neither world—the true in-between.
3.  **The Ritual Object:** A key, a jacket, a bag—something that physically marks the passage.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Upon leaving the previous space, say: "I am in passage." Do not bring the previous room with you mentally.
* **Step 1:** Move through the transitional space at a measured pace. Feel yourself changing.
* **Step 2:** If thoughts of either the previous or next room arise, acknowledge them and let them pass. "Not yet. I am in passage."
* **Exit Rite:** Upon arriving at the threshold of the next room, pause. Breathe. Say: "I have arrived." Only then enter.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** You spend the commute rehearsing the work meeting. You spend the hallway answering Slack. You skip the transition entirely.
* **The Result:** **Phase Contamination.** The previous room's state bleeds into the new room. You arrive at home still at work. You arrive at work still in bed. Neither room functions because you are never fully in any.
