# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 070

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Eulogy
* **Wing:** VI. The Observatory (Metacognition)
* **Phase Space:** Meta-State (Urgency)
* **Archetype:** The Mortality Reminder

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
Death is the ultimate constraint. The Eulogy is where you remember this—not morbidly, but motivationally. What would you want said at your funeral? What are you doing about it?

$$U_{\text{life}} = \int_0^{T_{\text{death}}} V(t) \, dt; \quad T_{\text{death}} < \infty$$

* **Input Logic:** The fact of mortality. The question: how do I want to be remembered?
* **Output Logic:** Urgency. Clarified priorities. Wasted time exposed.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"Let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life. The living being is simply a kind of dead being, and a very rare kind."**
> And this rare life will end. The Eulogy is *memento mori*—the skull on the desk, the reminder of the grave. Not to terrify, but to *mobilize*. The one who remembers death lives more intensely. The one who forgets it sleepwalks until the final surprise.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Honesty Imperative:** Face death directly, not metaphorically.
2.  **The Desired Legacy Question:** What do you want to be said about you?
3.  **The Current Gap:** How far is your current life from that desired legacy?

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Blank Page:** To write the eulogy you want.
2.  **The Silence:** Contemplation requires quiet.
3.  **The Evidence:** What have you actually done that earns the eulogy?

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Sit with mortality. Say: "I will die. What then?"
* **Step 1:** Write the eulogy you want delivered. What did this person contribute? How did they live?
* **Step 2:** Compare to current trajectory. What would actually be said if you died today?
* **Exit Rite:** Note the gap. Ask: "What must change?" Say: "I return to life with urgency."

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** Morbid fixation. Death becomes a source of paralysis, not urgency.
* **The Result:** **Death Obsession.** The Eulogy was supposed to inspire action. Instead, it inspires despair. You cannot move because all is futile.
