# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 007

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Hearth
* **Wing:** I. The Foundation (Restoration)
* **Phase Space:** Low ($D$) / Low ($A$)
* **Archetype:** The Primordial Anchor

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
For a million years, fire was the center of human consciousness. The dancing flame satisfied the attention circuits without demanding cognitive work. The Hearth exploits this ancient psychoacoustic attractor—a focal point that holds the mind still.

$$\frac{\partial \text{Attention}}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \vec{J}_{\text{distraction}} + S_{\text{flame}}$$

* **Input Logic:** Fire-light (or suitable substitute) as sole visual input. Crackling or ambient sound.
* **Output Logic:** Attention anchors. The mind stops its scattered wandering. Alpha wave states emerge.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"Man needs what is most evil in him for what is best in him."**
> Before there were screens, there was fire. Before there were notifications, there was the crack of burning wood. The Hearth reconnects you to the original attentional technology—the first screen, the first podcast, the first social network (the tribe gathered around). This is not nostalgia; it is neurobiological homecoming. When you stare into flame, you are staring into your own deep past, and something ancient in you relaxes because it remembers: *We survived. We have warmth. We are safe.*

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Flame Presence:** Actual fire preferred. Candle acceptable. Video of fire—weak but permitted as last resort.
2.  **The Darkness Surround:** The flame must be the dominant light source. Overhead lights extinguished.
3.  **The Silence or Crackle:** No verbal content. Only fire sounds, wind, or silence.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Fire Source:** Fireplace, fire pit, candle cluster, or simulated fire.
2.  **The Chair or Floor Cushion:** Positioned at proper viewing angle. Fire should fill peripheral vision.
3.  **The Blanket:** Warmth from without, warmth from within.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Light the fire (or candles). Extinguish other lights. Take your seat. Announce to yourself: "I am home."
* **Step 1:** Gaze at the flame. Not with concentration, but with soft attention. Let the eyes relax.
* **Step 2:** Allow thoughts to arise and be consumed by the fire. You are not thinking—you are watching.
* **Exit Rite:** When the fire dies or time completes, sit in the afterglow for a moment. Carry the stillness with you.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** You use the fire as background while scrolling. You turn the Hearth into the Hearth Plus Phone.
* **The Result:** **Divided Presence.** The ancient circuit activates, but the modern circuit overrides it. You gain neither the peace of fire nor the stimulation of the scroll. You sit in limbo.
