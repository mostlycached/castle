# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 060

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Mask
* **Wing:** V. The Forum (Exchange)
* **Phase Space:** Variable ($D$) / Variable ($A$)
* **Archetype:** The Role Simulator

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
The self is not fixed. It is a repertoire. The Mask is the room where you deliberately adopt a persona—for performance, exploration, protection, or play.

$$\text{Persona}_{\text{active}} = f(\text{Context}, \text{Goal}); \quad \text{Core Self} \neq \text{Persona}$$

* **Input Logic:** A role to play, an avatar to inhabit, a persona to try on.
* **Output Logic:** Expanded behavioral range. Self-knowledge through contrast.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"Every profound spirit needs a mask."**
> And the mask is not false—it is *functional*. The Mask room is where you become someone else: the confident speaker, the patient listener, the bold asker. You are not lying—you are exploring who else you could be. The Mask teaches: identity is performance, and performance can be chosen.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Conscious Adoption:** You know you are wearing a mask. This is not self-delusion.
2.  **The Ethical Boundary:** The mask may not be used to deceive for harm.
3.  **The Return Path:** You can always remove the mask and return to core self.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Role Definition:** Who are you pretending to be? What are their traits?
2.  **The Context:** Where is the mask worn? Work, stage, social event?
3.  **The Mirror:** A way to see yourself in the mask—literally or metaphorically.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Define the persona. Say: "I am now playing X." Put on the mask.
* **Step 1:** Inhabit the role. Speak as X would speak. Move as X would move.
* **Step 2:** Observe from inside: What does X know that I don't? What can X do that I can't?
* **Exit Rite:** When the context ends, remove the mask. Say: "I return to myself." Integrate what was learned.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** The mask fuses. You forget it's a mask. The persona displaces the self.
* **The Result:** **Identity Confusion.** You lose access to who you are beneath the performance. The Mask, which was supposed to be a tool, becomes a prison.
