# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 006

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Sick Bay
* **Wing:** I. The Foundation (Restoration)
* **Phase Space:** Low ($D$) / Low ($A$)
* **Archetype:** The Mercy Room

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
The organism has entered a degraded state. Energy available for allocation has collapsed. The Sick Bay acknowledges this reality and suspends all performance expectations. The equation here is purely thermodynamic: conserve what little remains.

$$E_{\text{available}} \ll E_{\text{required}}; \quad \therefore \text{Suspend all non-essential functions}$$

* **Input Logic:** Comfort stimuli only. Warmth, softness, nourishment. Zero demands.
* **Output Logic:** Gradual restoration of energy reserves. Permission to be weak.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy."**
> The Will to Power has its seasons. There is the surge, the striving, the overcoming—but there is also the ebb, the falling, the lying still. Modern culture denies this half of existence. It treats sickness as failure, fragility as sin. The Sick Bay is the room where you are granted something radical: *permission*. Permission to stop. To need. To be held by blankets instead of ambitions. The strong know when to be weak. The wise know that recovery is not the failure to produce—it is the production of future strength.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Guilt Ban:** No shame may enter. You are not "wasting time." You are healing.
2.  **The Productivity Abolition:** No work. No "catching up while resting." The body knows when you're lying.
3.  **The Comfort Mandate:** All inputs must be soothing. Harsh light, loud sounds, cold drafts—all banished.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Soft Nest:** Bed piled with blankets, pillows. A cocoon against the world.
2.  **The Warm Drink:** Tea, broth, warm water with honey. Medicine by other means.
3.  **The Gentle Content:** If entertainment is needed, only the most comforting. Familiar shows, soft music, nothing demanding.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Say: "I am unwell, and that is permitted." Cancel what can be cancelled. Lower expectations to zero.
* **Step 1:** Lie down. Wrap yourself in warmth. Breathe.
* **Step 2:** Accept nourishment. Sleep if sleep comes. Watch comfort content without guilt. Do *nothing* productive.
* **Exit Rite:** Leave only when the body signals readiness. Do not force. The Sick Bay's door opens from the inside only when you are genuinely restored.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** You "push through." You check email from bed. You treat sickness as an obstacle rather than a signal.
* **The Result:** **Prolonged Degradation.** What would have been a two-day recovery becomes a two-week decline. The body, denied its rest, extracts it later with compound interest.
