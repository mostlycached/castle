# THE 72 ROOMS OF ATTENTION
## *Architectural Specifications for the Allocation of Consciousness*

---

> **"Life is modeled as the allocation of Dionysian Energy ($D$) onto Apollonian Forms ($A$)."**
> — The Architect

---

## Overview

The 72 Rooms represent a complete architecture for human attention—a taxonomy of states, activities, and modes of being, each with its own physics, its own dangers, and its own gifts. 

**The Framework:**
- **$D$ (Dionysian):** Chaos, raw energy, impulse, the storm, high entropy
- **$A$ (Apollonian):** Order, structure, constraint, rules, low entropy  
- **$L$ (Observer Gain):** The metacognitive awareness of the current state
