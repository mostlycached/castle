# ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATION: ROOM 065

### **I. IDENTITY**
* **Name:** The Simulator
* **Wing:** VI. The Observatory (Metacognition)
* **Phase Space:** Meta-State (Pre-computation)
* **Archetype:** The Future Runner

### **II. THE PHYSICS (The Equation)**
The future has not happened. The Simulator creates models of possible futures—running scenarios to prepare for contingencies and inoculate against anxiety.

$$\text{Scenario}_i = f(\text{Initial Conditions}, \text{Actions}, \text{Environment}); \quad \text{Prepare}(\{\text{Scenario}_i\})$$

* **Input Logic:** An upcoming situation with uncertainty.
* **Output Logic:** Pre-computed responses. Reduced surprise. Stoic equanimity.

### **III. THE EVOCATIVE WHY (The Soul)**
> **"It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it."**
> And one of the wastes is being surprised by what could have been anticipated. The Simulator is the Stoic's *premeditatio malorum*—the pre-meditation of evils. You imagine the worst so that when it comes, you have already rehearsed. This is not pessimism. It is preparation. The Simulator takes the fangs out of the future by facing it in advance.

### **IV. THE ARCHITECTURE (The Hard Constraints)**
*If any of these walls are breached, the room collapses.*

1.  **The Scenario Specificity:** Imagine concrete futures, not vague dread.
2.  **The Response Focus:** For each scenario, what is your response? The value is in the preparation.
3.  **The Bounded Rehearsal:** Do not loop endlessly. Simulate, prepare, exit.

### **V. THE ALTAR (The Material Artifacts)**
1.  **The Scenario Canvas:** Paper, diagram, imagination space.
2.  **The Timer:** Bound the simulation.
3.  **The Response Log:** Write down: If X, then I will Y.

### **VI. THE LITURGY (The Protocol)**
* **Entry Rite:** Define the situation. Say: "I simulate what might happen."
* **Step 1:** Generate scenarios—best case, worst case, likely case.
* **Step 2:** For each scenario, rehearse the response. What will you do? How will you feel?
* **Exit Rite:** Close the simulation. Say: "I am prepared for what may come." Return to present.

### **VII. THE TRAP (Failure Mode)**
* **The Leak:** Simulation becomes rumination. You loop endlessly on worst case without preparing.
* **The Result:** **Pre-Traumatization.** You suffer the future in advance without gaining any preparedness. The Simulator, misused, becomes an anxiety amplifier.
