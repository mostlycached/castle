# Contrast: 72 Rooms vs. Seeds

## The Core Difference

| Dimension | 72 Rooms (Castle) | Seeds (Schema) |
|:----------|:------------------|:---------------|
| **Metaphor** | A **building** you inhabit | A **garden** you plant |
| **Ontology** | **States** of attention | **Materials** for becoming |
| **Question** | "Where am I right now?" | "What could I use to move?" |
| **Action** | **Navigate** (enter a room) | **Deploy** (plant a seed) |
| **Time** | Synchronic (present state) | Diachronic (trajectory, growth) |
| **Unit** | Room (attentional configuration) | Seed (catalyst for change) |

## What Each System Does Well

### Rooms: Diagnosis
*"You are in Room 010: The Swamp. Designated rotting zone."*
- Gives you **position** on the map.
- Names the state, which makes it controllable.
- Provides the **Dashboard** (Room 061: The Bridge) for meta-navigation.

### Seeds: Prescription
*"You lack Relational Seeds (Antagonist). Consider productive friction."*
- Gives you **materials** for construction.
- Identifies **gaps** in your assemblage.
- Suggests what to **acquire** or **encounter**.

## The Integration: Rooms × Seeds

The two systems are **complementary**, not competing.

### Model 1: Seeds Inside Rooms
Each Room can be **seeded** with particular materials. The Room is the container; the Seeds are the contents.

| Room | Default Seeds | Generative Seeds |
|:-----|:--------------|:-----------------|
| **008 Library (Quiet)** | Symbolic (books) | Counter-genre texts, Affective texts |
| **034 Dojo** | Temporal (routine), Material (instrument) | Practice manuals, Figure (exemplar) |
| **050 Salon** | Relational (Interlocutor, Antagonist) | Counter-tradition ideas, Limit concepts |
| **027 Studio (Closed)** | Material (Instrument, Surface) | Hybrid forms, Primary sources |

> **Use Case:** *"I am in The Dojo (Room 034). What seeds could make this practice crack open?"* → Add a Counter-genre text to the drill. Add an Antagonist (sparring partner who opposes your style).

### Model 2: Seeds as Room-Changers
A Seed can **move you** from one Room to another.

| Seed Type | Effect on Room |
|:----------|:---------------|
| **Counter-value (Symbolic)** | Destabilizes current Room → Forces you to The Courtroom (022) or The Void (048) |
| **Pack formation (Institutional)** | Moves you from solo Rooms → Forum Rooms (049-060) |
| **Deadline (Temporal)** | Collapses Wilderness/Foundation Rooms → Machine Shop (025-036) |
| **Antagonist (Relational)** | Any Room → Negotiating Table (052) or Arena (029) |

> **Use Case:** *"I've been in The Garden (003) for too long. What seed would move me?"* → A Deadline (Temporal Seed) would force you into The Sprint (030).

### Model 3: Rooms as Seed Containers
Certain Rooms are **designed** for certain Seed categories.

| Seed Category | Natural Rooms |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| **Symbolic** | Library (008), Classroom (021), Salon (050) |
| **Institutional** | Classroom (021), Hive (033), Public Square (059) |
| **Event** | Arena (029), Feast (044), Campfire (051) |
| **Material** | Forge (026), Kitchen (028), Studio (027), Laboratory (031) |
| **Spatial** | (The Rooms ARE spatial seeds) |
| **Temporal** | Morning Chapel (013), Checkpoint (016), Sabbath (implicit in 003) |
| **Relational** | All Forum Rooms (049-060), Campfire (051), Mentor's Office (057) |

## The Extended Seed Categories (Crisis, Wound, Return, Refusal, Animism)

Your `seeds/` folder includes categories beyond ENUMERATION.md:
- **Animism** — Elemental forces (Fire, Sea, Earth, etc.)
- **Crisis** — Seeds that arrive uninvited (illness, loss)
- **Wound** — Ontological constraints (temporal, spatial)
- **Return** — Calling back to something abandoned
- **Refusal** — Cutting away, stopping

These map to the **Meta-level** (Observatory Wing):

| Extended Seed | Observatory Room |
|:--------------|:-----------------|
| **Animism** (Elemental grip) | Totem (071), Storm Chaser (046) |
| **Crisis** (Uninvited rupture) | Sick Bay (006), War Room (035), Void Active (048) |
| **Wound** (Ontological constraint) | Eulogy (070), Camera Obscura (064), Silent Retreat (069) |
| **Return** (Calling back) | Museum (063), Dream Journal (067) |
| **Refusal** (Cutting away) | Exit (072), Confessional (020) |

## Proposed Synthesis

### Operational Model
1. **Use Rooms to diagnose.** "Where am I?"
2. **Use Seeds to prescribe.** "What could I add, subtract, or encounter?"
3. **Use the Five Operations (from RUFF.md) to transform.** Symmetry finding, Symmetry breaking, Gray Hole Discovery, Anomaly Management, Destruction.

### The Formula
> **Room** + **Seed** + **Operation** = **Transformation**

Example:
- **Room:** 049 The River (Cafe, alone together)
- **Seed:** Counter-genre text (Symbolic) + Interlocutor (Relational)
- **Operation:** Symmetry Finding (What rhymes between the book and the conversation?)
- **Result:** New line of flight. The cafe becomes a Salon (050).

## Summary Table

| Concept | Rooms | Seeds |
|:--------|:------|:------|
| Answers | Where am I? | What could I use? |
| Unit | State | Material |
| Time | Now | Trajectory |
| Mode | Navigate | Deploy |
| Failure Mode | Crypt (dead room) | Empty category (no fuel) |

> **Integration:** Rooms are the **container**. Seeds are the **contents**. The Five Operations are the **chemistry**.
